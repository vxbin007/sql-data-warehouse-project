SQL Data Warehouse Project | Data with Baraa | Programming with Mosh


This project demonstrates my learning and hands-on application of SQL Data Warehouse concepts. 
It includes the implementation of a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers), data modeling with dimension and fact views, and ETL logic using SQL.

I built this project as part of my learning journey applying what I learned from Data with Baraa and Code with Mosh, 
including writing SQL queries, data modeling, creating views, and managing staged data in a warehouse environment.
